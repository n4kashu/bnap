Bitcoin Native Asset Minting & NFT Issuance Platform - Product Requirements Document
1. Introduction
This Product Requirements Document outlines the development of a Bitcoin-native asset minting and NFT issuance platform for the Retest network. The document serves as a comprehensive guide for the development team, stakeholders, and project managers to understand the scope, requirements, and technical specifications necessary to build a minimum viable product (MVP) that enables the creation and management of fungible tokens and non-fungible tokens directly on the Bitcoin blockchain using advanced scripting capabilities.
The platform leverages Bitcoin's Taproot and P2WSH technologies to create a secure, efficient, and privacy-preserving system for digital asset issuance while maintaining compatibility with standard Bitcoin transactions and existing wallet infrastructure.
2. Product overview
2.1 Product description
The Bitcoin Native Asset Platform is a comprehensive solution for issuing and managing digital assets on the Bitcoin Retest network. The platform supports two primary asset types: fungible tokens (currencies, utility tokens) and non-fungible tokens (unique digital collectibles). Using colored outputs and covenant-based controls, the system enables secure asset creation while maintaining full Bitcoin compatibility.
2.2 Key capabilities

Dual covenant approach: Support for both Taproot (P2TR) and P2WSH formats
Rule-based issuance: Enforced supply caps, per-mint limits, and allowlist restrictions
Metadata management: Secure binding of content to NFTs via cryptographic hashes
Registry system: Centralized tracking of asset rules and issuance state
Validator component: Single-signer authority simulating multi-signature quorum
Standard Bitcoin compatibility: All transactions are valid Bitcoin transactions

2.3 Value proposition
The platform provides organizations and developers with the ability to create Bitcoin-native assets without requiring additional blockchain layers or sidechains, ensuring maximum security and decentralization while leveraging Bitcoin's existing infrastructure and network effects.
